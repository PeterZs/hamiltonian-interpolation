# Run the test script:
* python3 main_interpolation.py
* You can specify to compute an interpolation with one of the other methods in the main script in main_interpolation.py

# Use your own examples:
* For different input shapes, see tools/shape_utils.py to load shapes with an equivalent meshing and tools/partial_shapes.py for shapes with incompatible meshing or partial shapes.
* You can also prepare the input pair such that they have compatible vertices, e.g. by transferring the meshing with the correspondences beforehand.
* Compute interpolations for a complete dataset with the routine "main_dataset" in main_interpolation.py
* Evaluate the error metrics from the paper with the scripts in interpolation/eval_interpolation.py
